# Software Development Internship

As part of the software development internship of the Bachelor of Computational Engineering Science at RWTH Aachen University, students will work in small groups on a software project of an internal institute in order to gain an insight into software development.
In addition to learning the Qt framework, team skills, maintainability and documentation are key learning goals of the course.
 This version of the software was developed by:
 - Simon Schäfer
 - Markus Klaus Mizael Moser
 - Sören Mehnert
 - Sharon Michael Rouf-Chowdhury
 
This project precedes the actual project of the institute.
This is an integration software.
More precisely, there are three functions and three integration methods to choose from.
The resulting framework is able to integrate much more complex functions because the parameter p is treated as a string, any functions on the software side can be used.
Assuming that the corresponding function is implemented and registered in the library.

## Installation

Installation instructions are available [here](code/README.md)

## Documentation

A documentation can be generated with Doxygen.
Further details can be found in the Wiki.
